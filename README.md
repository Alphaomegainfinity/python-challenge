# python-challenge
This is the Module 3 Python Challenge.

There are 2 folders (PyBank and PyPoll) that aim to analyse how to pull the data out from a specific column.

For the PyBank folder, the csv and os module were used to allow users to read a file at any operating system. The loop function was used to find out the total number of months, the average changes overall and pointing out the biggest increase as well as the greatest decrease.

Then exporting the outcome to external file (outcome.txt) 

For the PyPoll folder, the csv and os module were used to allow users to read a file at any operating system. The loop function was used to go through all the data value. Then creating a dictionary with a set list to count all the candidates and make sure that all the name were counted correctly and they are all unique.

The max function was used to see who had the highest score.
